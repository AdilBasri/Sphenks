# Sphenks Demo - Build & Distribution Guide

## 🎮 Quick Start

### Option 1: Run from Source (Development)
```bash
python main.py
```

### Option 2: Run the Standalone Executable
```bash
dist/Sphenks_Demo/Sphenks_Demo.exe
```

---

## 🔨 Building the Executable

We've created two build scripts to simplify the PyInstaller process:

### For Windows Users:
```bash
build_exe.bat
```

### For Python Users (All Platforms):
```bash
python build_exe.py
```

### Or manually with PyInstaller:
```bash
pyinstaller --noconsole --onedir --icon=assets/icon.ico ^
    --add-data "sounds;sounds" ^
    --add-data "assets;assets" ^
    --hidden-import=cv2 ^
    --name "Sphenks_Demo" ^
    main.py
```

## 📦 What Gets Included

The build process automatically bundles:
- ✅ All Python code (compiled to bytecode)
- ✅ Font files (`assets/fonts/`)
- ✅ Sound effects (`sounds/`)
- ✅ Required dependencies (Pygame, OpenCV, NumPy, etc.)

**Result:** Single `dist/Sphenks_Demo/` folder with everything needed to run the game!

---

## 🎯 Distribution

To share the game:

1. **Build the EXE:**
   ```bash
   python build_exe.py
   ```

2. **Distribute the folder:**
   ```
   dist/Sphenks_Demo/
   ```

3. **Users just need to run:**
   ```
   Sphenks_Demo.exe
   ```

No installation needed! No Python required! No missing assets!

## 🔧 File Structure

```
Sphenks_Demo.exe          ← Main executable
_internal/                ← Auto-generated by PyInstaller
  ├── assets/             ← Fonts, images, video
  ├── sounds/             ← Game sounds
  ├── pygame/             ← Game framework
  ├── cv2/                ← Computer vision library
  └── ... (other dependencies)
```

## ✨ Key Features of the Build System

### Smart Resource Loading (`resource_path()`)
The game uses an intelligent path resolver that:
1. First checks PyInstaller's `_MEIPASS` folder
2. Then checks next to the executable
3. Falls back to development directory

This means the **same code works** whether you:
- Run from Python source
- Run the compiled EXE
- Run from any directory

### Multi-Format Audio Support
The game handles:
- `.wav` files
- `.mp3` files
- `.ogg` files

### Font Management
All 8 languages' fonts are bundled:
- English, Turkish, German, Spanish
- Chinese (custom font), Portuguese, French, Italian

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Sounds not playing?
✅ Fixed! The `sounds/` folder is now included in the `--add-data` parameter.

### Missing assets?
✅ Fixed! Using `resource_path()` function to locate files in `_internal/` folder.

### EXE won't start?
- Check Windows Defender hasn't blocked it
- Run from Command Prompt to see error messages
- Make sure all files are in the `dist/Sphenks_Demo/` folder

### Build takes too long?
That's normal! PyInstaller:
- Analyzes all dependencies
- Compiles Python to bytecode
- Bundles everything together

First build: ~30-60 seconds
Subsequent builds: ~10-20 seconds

## 📝 Notes

- **Size:** ~500MB (mostly due to OpenCV for video playback)
- **Requirements:** Windows 10+
- **No admin rights needed** to run the EXE
- **Fully portable** - no system dependencies

Enjoy! 🎮✨
